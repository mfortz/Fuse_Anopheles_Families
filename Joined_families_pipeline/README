Tutorial for Joined_families_analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Method for finding pairs of gene families that should be joined. Executable 
scripts are:
# shared_nbr_candidates.py
# tandem_duplicate_candidates.py
# silhouette.py
# FDR_analysis.py         
# plotHelper.py

Instructions for running each script are below. Arguments (inputs and output 
names) are given in order.

Commonly used inputs are:
    # all gene file - gives information on all genes. Contains 9 columns: 
        species, ctg, gene_family, gene_name, gene_orientation, start_gene,
        end_gene, # of exons, and exons_position.
        Assumes first row is a header.

    # similarity score file - gives a similarity score to a pair of genes. 
		First two columns are for gene names (must match name in 
		all_gene_file), and the third column contains the similarity score.
		Suggested software: GenFamClust *

shared_nbr_candidates.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Find pairs of families (f1,f2) which are present in complementary species, 
and both has a member gene that is adjacent/syntenic to a third family. Usage:

	$ python shared_nbr_candidates.py <all gene file>
	  <num_species_spanned_by_f1> <output file>

Output: family pairs.


tandem_duplicate_candidates.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Finds pairs of families which has multiple syntenic members. Usage:

	$ python tandem_duplicate_candidates.py <all gene file>
	  <max_species_spanned_by_f1> <ratio> <output file>

where ratio = num_observed_synteny / num_species_spanned_by_f1, and f1 is 
taken be the smaller family.

Output: family pairs.


NOTE: It is recommended that these two lists be joined.

	$ cat file1 file2 > all_candidates_file

silhouette.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Calculates the silhouette of gene families. Contains three modules:
'all_families', 'joined', and shuffled'.Usage:

	$ python silhoutte.py <module> [args]

Modules:

# all_families - gives silhouette of all gene families. 
	Inputs:
	1. similarity score file
	2. all gene file
	Output: 
	3. all silhouette file

# joined - takes a list of family pairs, usually the candidate pairs. Every 
pair is joined and the silhouette is calculated for the joined family. Reports 
the change in silhouette after joining the pair.
	Inputs:
	1. similarity score file
	2. all gene file
	3. all silhouette file
	4. family pairs file
	Output:
	5. joined families silhouette

# shuffled - used for null dataset of FDR method. Shuffles edge weights, 
recalculates silhouettes, joins family pairs with an edge between them, then 
reports the change in silhouette after joining. 
	Inputs:
	Inputs:
	1. similarity score file
	2. all gene file
	Output:
	3. shuffled edge weights
	4. shuffled all silhouette file
	5. shuffled joined families silhouette
	6. (bool) - shuffle intra-cluster weights?

FDR_analysis.py 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Calculates threshold t that satisfies the given false discovery rate (FDR). 
Datasets used are joined families silhouette of observed (suggested: candidates) and null (suggested: shuffled). Usage:

	$ python FDR_analysis.py <observed dataset> <null dataset> <FDR>

Output: t, and final FDR.

plotHelper.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Methods to plot silhouette distributions. Also prints mean and standard 
deviation of the distribution. Usage:

	$ python plotHelper.py <module> <input>

Modules:
	1. 'all_families' - silhouette distribution on all families and all genes.
		Input: all silhouette file.
	2. 'joined' - change in silhouette distribution after joining family pairs.
		Input: joined families silhouette.
